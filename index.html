                <h3>Original</h3>
                <p>The story of the Hot Crossed Buns brand started more than 50 years ago when Dr. Peter Buck,
                a nuclear physicist, changed the life of a college student with a few simple words, 
                “Let’s open a submarine sandwich shop.”</p>
                
                <p>It was Peter Buck that gave college freshman Fred DeLuca the idea to open a submarine sandwich shop 
                to help pay his tuition. Peter provided an initial investment of $1000, and a business relationship 
                was forged that would change the landscape of the fast food industry and the lives of thousands.
                The partners opened their first restaurant in Bridgeport, Connecticut, where they served fresh, 
                affordable, made to order sandwiches. The popularity of the sandwiches and the brand continued to 
                grow over the decades but one thing remained the same and that was their core values and principles.</p>

                <h3>Healthy</h3>
                <p>Hot Crossed Buns offers a large variety of nutritionally balanced sandwiches 
                    (when made with all the fresh veggies):</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Free of artificial trans fat free (no partially-hydrogenated oil).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Essential nutrients Vitamin A & C, and iron.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Complex carbohydrates and a good source of protein (with the exception of Veggie Delite®).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The 6-inch 9 Grain Wheat and 9-Grain Honey Oat contain 24 grams of whole grains and 4g of fiber, 
                        while the multigrain flatbread contains 50g whole grains and 6g of fiber.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        With the average daily recommended calorie level of 2000, many of our sandwiches made on Italian or 
                        9-Grain bread have sensible calorie-content when prepared according to standard recipe.

                <h3>Fresh</h3>
                <p>Food safety and food quality are our top priorities. Our goal is to serve food that 
                consistently meets the highest quality and safety standards – from the time it is grown, 
                harvested or caught to when it is put into a sandwich or salad in our restaurants.</p>

                <p>Our high standards for food safety ensure that our guests are getting the quality our consumers 
                expect from us. It begins with setting detailed product specifications followed by 
                inspection of samples pulled from distribution to ensure that specifications are being met. 
                All approved facilities that supply food to Hot Crossed Buns, undergo a rigorous third-party 
                audit for food safety, HAACP (Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point) and GMPs 
                (Good Manufacturing Practices). In addition, our auditing process ensures that good agricultural 
                and harvesting practices (GAP’s and GHP’s) are used by the ranches and farms that supply produce 
                to us. The auditing bodies vary by country. For instance, in the United States we use the USDA to 
                audit to this standard.</p>
